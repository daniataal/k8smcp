# MLOps Platform Web-Based GUI Design

This document outlines the design for a web-based, no-code MLOps platform GUI, focusing on its interaction with the existing Python backend services. It incorporates advanced features like chatbot integration, flexible Kubernetes configuration, and the conceptual deployment of observability stacks.

## 1. Architecture Overview

*   **Frontend (UI Layer):** A Single-Page Application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).
*   **Backend (API Layer):** The existing Python Flask server (`server.py`) exposing RESTful APIs (via MCP tools). This layer will be extended to support new functionalities.
*   **Real-time Communication:** For chatbot streaming, a WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) channel will be required between frontend and backend.
*   **Kubernetes Interaction:** The backend directly interacts with the Kubernetes API using `kubernetes-client/python` (through `k8s_debugger.py` and `mlops_workflow.py`).

## 2. Key UI Components and Pages

### 2.1. Dashboard (Homepage)

*   **Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview of the MLOps ecosystem.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Workflow Status Summary:** Number of running, succeeded, failed workflows.
    *   **Deployed Models:** Quick glance at actively deployed models, their status (e.g., healthy, unhealthy), and current stage (production, staging).
    *   **Key Metrics Snapshot:** Display aggregated metrics like total inference requests, error rates, and active drift alerts (conceptual, requiring backend aggregation).
    *   **Recent Activity Feed:** Latest workflow runs, model deployments, and critical alerts.
    *   **Quick Links:** Navigation to Workflow Management, Model Registry, Monitoring, Settings.

### 2.2. Workflow Management

*   **"Create New Workflow" Page:**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow users to define and trigger MLOps pipelines without writing code.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Workflow Type Selection:** Dropdown for `model_type` (e.g., "mnist_pytorch_cnn", dynamically loaded from `MODEL_CONFIGURATIONS`).
        *   **Training Parameters Form:**
            *   Input fields for `epochs`, `batch_size`.
            *   Optional advanced settings: `namespace`, `resource_requests` (CPU, Memory), `resource_limits` (CPU, Memory).
            *   **Data Parameters Section:**
                *   `data_source`: Dropdown/radio for "dvc", "s3", "gcs", "local_path", "database".
                *   `path`: Input field for data path (e.g., "data/mnist" for DVC, S3 bucket path).
        *   **Deployment Parameters Form:**
            *   Input fields for `replicas`.
            *   Optional advanced settings: `namespace`, `resource_requests` (CPU, Memory), `resource_limits` (CPU, Memory).
            *   `deploy_if_trained_success` toggle.
        *   **Trigger Options:**
            *   "Run Now" button (calls `mlops_execute_workflow`).
            *   "Schedule Workflow" section:
                *   Input for `schedule_interval` (e.g., "daily", "hourly", "cron string").
                *   "Schedule" button (calls `mlops_schedule_workflow`).
            *   "Event-Driven Trigger Setup" section (conceptual):
                *   Instructions/UI to configure external event sources (webhooks, Kafka topics) that would call `mlops_trigger_workflow_event` on the backend.
*   **"Active Workflows" List:**
    *   **Purpose:** Monitor the status and history of MLOps workflow executions.
    *   **Components:**
        *   Table with `job_id`, `model_type`, current `status` (Running, Succeeded, Failed), `start_time`, `end_time`.
        *   **Action Buttons:** "View Logs," "Cancel Job" (conceptual, backend would need a K8s job cancellation tool).
        *   **"View Logs" (Drill-down):** Display logs from `mlops_workflow._log_experiment_result` and potentially direct Kubernetes Job/Pod logs via `k8s_debugger.get_pod_logs`.

### 2.3. Model Registry

*   **"Registered Models" List:**
    *   **Purpose:** Centralized view of all managed models.
    *   **Components:**
        *   Table with `model_id`, `job_id`, `version`, `status` (registered, staging, production, archived), key `metrics` (accuracy, loss), `registered_at`.
        *   **Action Buttons:**
            *   "View Details" (navigates to Model Details page).
            *   "Deploy" (opens a simplified deployment form, calls `mlops_deploy_registered_model`).
            *   "Promote" (opens a form for `new_status` and `new_version`, calls `mlops_promote_model`).
            *   "Rollback" (opens a dialog to select `target_model_id`, calls `mlops_rollback_model`).
*   **"Model Details" Page:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provide comprehensive information about a single model.
    *   **Components:**
        *   All metadata from `mlops_get_model_details`.
        *   Visualization of historical metrics (requires fetching/parsing logged metrics).
        *   Version history timeline with status for each version.
        *   Deployment history.

### 2.4. Monitoring & Alerts

*   **"Inference Monitoring Dashboard":**
    *   **Purpose:** Visualize real-time inference metrics.
    *   **Components:**
        *   (Conceptual) Embedded Grafana dashboards or custom charts displaying:
            *   Total Requests (from `PREDICTION_COUNT`).
            *   Request Latency (from `PREDICTION_LATENCY`).
            *   Error Rates (if instrumented).
            *   Model-specific metrics.
*   **"Drift Alerts" View:**
    *   **Purpose:** Display and manage detected data/concept drift alerts.
    *   **Components:**
        *   List of alerts (parsed from `_send_alert` logs or a dedicated alert store).
        *   Details: `alert_type`, `message`, `timestamp`, `details` (e.g., `model_name`, `avg_confidence`).
        *   Action: "Acknowledge Alert."

### 2.5. Data Management (Conceptual)

*   **"Data Ingestion" Interface:**
    *   **Purpose:** Configure and trigger data ingestion pipelines.
    *   **Components:**
        *   Form for `data_source_type` (S3, GCS, local path, database connection strings).
        *   Input for `connection_details` (e.g., bucket name, file path, database credentials).
        *   "Ingest Data" button (calls `mlops_ingest_data`).
*   **"Feature Store" View:**
    *   **Purpose:** (Highly conceptual) Interact with a feature store.
    *   **Components:**
        *   List/search for available features.
        *   Option to `get_features` for specific entities (calls `mlops_get_features`).
        *   Option to `put_features` (calls `mlops_put_features`).

### 2.6. Settings

*   **Purpose:** Configure platform-wide settings and integrations.
*   **Components:**
    *   **LLM API Keys:**
        *   Input fields for `CLAUD_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
        *   "Save" button. (Backend would securely store these, e.g., in `claudeconfig.json` or environment variables).
    *   **Kubernetes Configuration:**
        *   **`Kubeconfig` File Selection:**
            *   Input field or file uploader for `kubeconfig` path.
            *   Explanation: The backend needs access to this file to interact with the cluster. This implies that the Flask server either needs to be running in an environment with `kubectl` configured, or the `kubeconfig` content needs to be passed securely to the backend or configured as an environment variable for the backend process.
            *   **Recommendation for actual implementation:** For a no-code platform, consider providing fields for K8s cluster endpoint, CA cert, and user token, which can then be used by `kubernetes-client` without needing a local `kubeconfig` file directly on the server's filesystem.
        *   **Default Namespace:** Input field for the default Kubernetes namespace.
    *   **Container Registry:** Input field for `CONTAINER_REGISTRY`.
    *   **Observability Stack Deployment:**
        *   **"Deploy Monitoring Stack" Button:**
            *   **Action:** Triggers a backend process to deploy Prometheus and Grafana.
            *   **Backend Logic (Conceptual):** The backend would contain pre-defined Kubernetes YAML templates for Prometheus (e.g., `kube-prometheus-stack` via Helm charts or raw manifests) and Grafana. Upon user action, it would:
                1.  Generate/customize these YAMLs (e.g., set namespace, storage options).
                2.  Use `k8s_debugger.apply_yaml` to deploy them.
                3.  Monitor the deployment status.
                4.  Provide feedback to the UI (success/failure, access URLs).
        *   **"Deploy Logging Stack" Button:**
            *   **Action:** Triggers a backend process to deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana (and potentially Fluentd/Fluent Bit for log collection).
            *   **Backend Logic (Conceptual):** Similar to monitoring, the backend would manage templates and deploy the Elastic Stack via Kubernetes YAMLs (e.g., Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes - ECK operator, or raw manifests).
            *   **Note:** Deploying and managing these complex stacks automatically is a significant engineering effort that would require extensive pre-defined, tested Kubernetes manifests and robust error handling on the backend. This is beyond generating a few Python scripts.
    *   **(Future) Cloud Provider Integrations:** API keys for AWS, GCP, Azure for cloud-specific services.

### 2.7. Chatbot Interaction

*   **"Assistant" or "Chat" Tab:**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow users to interact with the MLOps platform using natural language prompts.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Input Field:** For user queries.
        *   **Chat History Display:** Shows conversation flow.
        *   **Streaming Responses:** The backend should stream responses (using WebSockets or SSE) for a more interactive experience, especially for long-running operations or LLM generated content.
    *   **Backend Integration for Chat (Conceptual):**
        *   A new backend endpoint (e.g., `/chat`) that accepts user queries.
        *   This endpoint would:
            1.  Parse the user's natural language query.
            2.  Use LLMs (Claude/OpenAI via `claude_analyzer` or similar) to understand intent and determine which MLOps tool to call.
            3.  Dynamically construct and execute `mcp.tool()` calls (e.g., `mlops_execute_workflow`, `mlops_list_models`).
            4.  Stream intermediate progress/logs and the final result back to the frontend.
        *   **Tool Execution:** The chat backend would need access to all defined `mcp.tool()` functions and their arguments.

## 3. Frontend-Backend API Endpoints (Examples)

The frontend would make HTTP POST requests to endpoints that wrap the `mcp.tool` functions.

*   `POST /api/mlops/execute_workflow`
    *   Body: `{ "workflow_params": {...} }`
*   `POST /api/mlops/deploy_model`
    *   Body: `{ "model_id": "...", "namespace": "...", "replicas": ... }`
*   `GET /api/mlops/models`
    *   Response: `{ "models": [...] }`
*   `GET /api/mlops/model_details/{model_id}`
    *   Response: `{ "model_details": {...} }`
*   `POST /api/mlops/promote_model`
    *   Body: `{ "model_id": "...", "new_status": "...", "new_version": "..." }`
*   `POST /api/mlops/rollback_model`
    *   Body: `{ "current_model_id": "...", "target_model_id": "..." }`
*   `POST /api/mlops/schedule_workflow`
    *   Body: `{ "workflow_params": {...}, "schedule_interval": "..." }`
*   `POST /api/mlops/trigger_event`
    *   Body: `{ "event_type": "...", "event_data": {...} }`
*   `POST /api/settings/llm_keys`
    *   Body: `{ "claude_api_key": "...", "openai_api_key": "..." }` (requires secure storage backend)
*   `POST /api/settings/kubeconfig`
    *   Body: `{ "kubeconfig_path": "..." }` or `{ "cluster_config": {...} }`
*   `POST /api/infrastructure/deploy_monitoring`
    *   Body: `{ "namespace": "...", "storage_class": "..." }`
*   `POST /api/infrastructure/deploy_logging`
    *   Body: `{ "namespace": "...", "storage_class": "..." }`
*   `WS /ws/chat` or `GET /sse/chat` (for streaming chatbot)
    *   Sends user messages, receives LLM responses and tool output.

## 4. Considerations for a "Fully Functional" GUI

*   **Security:** API key storage, role-based access control (RBAC), secure communication.
*   **User Authentication:** User login, session management.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** Clear error messages, progress indicators, notifications.
*   **Scalability:** Frontend served from CDN, backend scalable (e.g., multiple Flask instances behind a load balancer).
*   **Persistence:** Configuration saved securely.
*   **User Experience (UX):** Intuitive layout, responsive design, accessibility.
*   **Observability Stack Details:** The "automatic deployment" of Prometheus/Grafana and Elastic/Kibana is highly complex. It would involve managing Helm charts or raw Kubernetes manifests, potentially requiring custom operators or significant pre-configuration. The backend would need to perform:
    *   YAML generation based on user inputs (namespace, storage class, ingress).
    *   Application of these YAMLs (`kubectl apply -f ...` via `k8s_debugger`).
    *   Monitoring the readiness of these deployed components.
    *   Potentially configuring data sources in Grafana/Kibana.

This detailed design provides a blueprint. Implementing it would typically involve a dedicated frontend development team. Please let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific section or integrate any part into the existing backend, keeping in mind my current tool limitations.
